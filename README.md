# Weather_API_Usage

# What this project does?

This python program uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get the localtime and current temperature of the user's given location and also saves the details into a json file with the name of the location given by the user.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages.

1. First of all create a isolated environment in your folder using following commands

```bash
i) virtualenv env
ii) source env/scripts\activate

```

2. Then install tools using  

 ```python
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. All of the packages needed in this project is installed 😀.
4. Then use `python3 main.py` to run the script.
5. Once you run the `main.py` file, it will automatically create a json file with the name of the user given location in the current directory.
